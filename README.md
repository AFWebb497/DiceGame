The rules themselves are as follows:

When you begin the game you are asked how many dice you would like to play with, from a choice of 3,4,5 or 6. Then you roll the dice by clicking the appropriate button and are awarded points based on the following combinations of dice rolls:

All unique numbers : Your score is the sum of the individual numbers rolled e.g. 4,6,3 = 13 points.

Consecutive numbers rolled : Sum of your dice numbers rolled + 20 points e.g. 1+2+3 = 26 points

Every dice is the same number: Sum of your dice rolls + 60 points e.g. 4,4,4 = 72 points.

Almost every dice is the same number : Sum of your dice rolls + 40 points e.g. 4,5,5 = 54 points.

You can roll the dice as many times as you want, and each time you points are collected and accumulated into a total which will be displayed at the end of the game, which you reach by pressing the button to end at any time. Then your total points as well as average score per round is displayed, and you are given the option to restart the game, with the same or different number of dice.
